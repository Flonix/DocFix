# Welcome to DocFix

## What is DocFix?

DocFix is a simple document / documentation generator written in Javascript.

## Features

* Automated generation of:
    * chapter summaries,
    * table of contents
* Navtags (a list of user-defined links inside the currently loaded chapter)
* Crossreferencing
* History API (going back to the previous cross reference)
* Direct / External linking of user-defined sections

## Documentation / Live-Demo

See the [Documentation side](http://docfix.flo.bezdeka.de/doc)


## How to Contribute

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the RESTlight repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **vNext** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull
request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
