<h2>Cross-Referencing</h2>

<h3>What is Crossreferencing ?</h3>
<a id="ref-setup" class="docfix-navtag">Cross references</a>

<p>
	From time to time it may make sense to add a link / reference to some other 
	sections or chapters of your documentation. DocFix is able to handle refrences 
	to targets inside any of the defined content files.
	Use the following examples and descriptions to set up a working reference.
</p>

<h3>Setting up a cross reference</h3>
<p>
	Setting up a cross reference is quite easy. It is nearly the same as 
	defining a link in HTML syntax.
</p>

<p>
	The following example will set up an cross reference to a destination called dest.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<a href="dest" class="docfix-crossref"> Link caption </a>
</pre>




<h3>Setting up a cross reference destination</h3>
<a id="ref-dest-setup" class="docfix-hidden"> </a>
<p>
	First of all, a destination can be every html tag used in your documentation.
	The only thing that matters is the value of the id attribute. 
</p>
<p>
	Please read "How crossreferencing works" to make sure your
	destination is really found in the document.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<a id="destinationA">destination content</a> 
<span id="destinationB">...</span>
</pre>

<p>
	All defined destinations can be directly reached from outside your DocFix documentation. 
	Look <a href="ref-external-link" class="docfix-crossref">here</a> for complete explanation.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	There is one destination called "all" which is not usable. (It will be overwritten by DocFix itself.)
	If this destination is requested, DocFix will generate one complete document and showing all content files at once.
</div>


<blockquote>
	You may use the css class <span class="label">docfix-hidden</span> to 
	hide your destination to the viewer.
	If someone searches for your destination or just clicks on a cross reference 
	the document will still be scrolled to the location of your destination.
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	Do not use the css class <span class="label">hidden</span> 
	for hiding your destination tags, because this will crash the scrolling.
</div>



<h3>How crossreferencing works</h3>

<p>
	DocFix will start searching for the requested target in the first content 
	file you defined. On success, that means if the requested target was found inside 
	the content file, the content file will be displayed and scrolled to the requested target.
</p>
<p>
	If the requested target id was not found inside the first content file, 
	DocFix searches the second content file and so on.
</p>
<p>
	Please take care of targets with identical target ids. Every search action will start 
	at the first defined content file. Therefore all targets with the same id that were 
	defined after the first match will never be found / displayed.
</p>


<h3 id="ref-external-link">Link to documentation content from outside DocFix</h3>
<p>
	DocFix allows you to define direct links to some content elements of your documentation.
</p>
<p>
	The following example will create a direct link to the target called targetID.
</p>
<p>
	Look <a href="ref-dest-setup" class="docfix-crossref">here</a> to find 
	out how reference targets are defined.
</p>
 
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<a href="http://pathToDocFix/?targetID">Goto targetID</a> 
</pre>


<h3>Navtags</h3>
<a id="ref-navtags" class="docfix-navtag">Navtags</a>

<h4>What is a Navtag?</h4>
<p>
	Can you see the list or navigation bar on the left? 
</p>
<p>
	The content of this navigation bar can be defined by setting up some (hidden) 
	hyperlinks.
</p>
<p>
	During the document parsing process DocFix searches for this tags and adds them 
	to the navigation bar. If you can see, the position of the document gets updated when  
	the user scrolls through your document.
</p>
<p>
	The name of the first navtag can be defined inside the configuration section. 
	Please look the documentation of the 
	<a href="config-setup" class="docfix-crossref">configuration options</a>
	in chapter one for details.
</p>

<blockquote>
	A navigation bar with navtags will only be shown, if at least one navtag was defined.
</blockquote>



<h4>How to define a Navtag</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<a id="uniqueNavtagID" class="docfix-navtag">Navtag title</a> 
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	Note: The uniqueNavtagID must only be unique within the affected content file.
</div>
