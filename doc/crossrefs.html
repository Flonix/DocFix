<h2>Cross-Referencing</h2>

<h3>What is Cross-Referencing ?</h3>


<h3>Setting up a cross reference</h3>
<p>
	Setting up a cross reference is quite easy. It is nearly the same as 
	defining a link in HTML syntax. Set the href attribute to "#" and add a onclick event.
</p>

<p>
	The following example will set up an cross-reference to a destination called dest.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
	<a href="#" onclick="docfix.search('dest');"> Link caption </a>
</pre>


<h3>Setting up a cross reference destination</h3>

<p>
	First of all, a destination can be every html tag used in your documentation.
	The only thing that matters is the value of the id attribute. 
</p>
<p>
	Please read "How cross-referencing works" to make sure your
	destination is really found in the document.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
	<a id="destinationA">sourcetag</a> 
	<span id="destinationB">...</span>
</pre>

<blockquote>
	You may use the css class <span class="label">docfix-hidden</span> to 
	hide your destination to the viewer.
	If someone searches for your destination or just clicks on a cross-reference 
	the document will still be scrolled to the location of your destination.
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	Do not use the css class <span class="label">hidden</span> 
	for hiding your destination tags, because this will crash the scrolling.
</div>
