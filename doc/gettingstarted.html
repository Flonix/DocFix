<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>What is DocFix ?</h3>
<p>
	DocFix is a simple documentation generator written in Javascript.
</p>
<p>
	See the following documentation for information about how to setup DocFix 
	and how to markup your documentation using a combination of html and css to 
	generate a fully indexed, and nice to read documentation.
</p>


<h3>Components of DocFix</h3>

<p>
	DocFix consists of four main components:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The DocFix template file (the html template)</li>
	<li>The DocFix templating engine (the javascript file)</li>
	<li>The DocFix css file (layout definitions) </li>
	<li>Your content files (files with your documentation / text inside)</li>
</ol>

<h4>The template file</h4>
<p>
	The template file is an html file, that includes the DocFix javascript part,
	the style definitions (css files) and some minimal DocFix configuration. You may
	have a look at the <span class="badge">index.html</span> 
	file from the top level directory of the DocFix repository. 
	This file contaions all required html tags and the mentioned references and configuration.
</p>

<h4>The templating engine</h4>
<p>
	The templating engine is just one javascript file called <span class="badge">docfix.js</span> 
	and located in the <span class="badge">js</span> folder of the DocFix repository. Your template 
	file has to reference this script.
</p>

<h4>Layout definitions</h4>
<p>
	The layout is defined in some css files within the <span class="badge">css</span> folder 
	of the DocFix repository. You may edit this files to change the documentation layout.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
	<strong>Note: </strong> The layout definition of DocFix is based on the bootstrap css library. You may also 
	use layout definitions out of this library.
</div>

<h4>Content files</h4>
<p>
	As you will see in the configuration section, DocFix is able to load your documentation 
	conten from several files. This enables you to split your documentation into different files.
</p>
<p>
	Your content files will be processed during the DocFix startup. See the "Features" section 
	to see what exactly will be done during the parsing process.
</p>



<h3>Features of DocFix</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Automated generation of
		<ul>
			<li>Table of contents</li>
			<li>Chapter summaries</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Numbering of headers</li>
	<li>Navtags</li>
	<li>Crossreferences</li>
	<li>Direct referencing of user defined content</li>
	
</ul>

<p>
	Some of the mentioned features require some content pre-processing before the 
	content is shown to the user. Therefore some html tags of your content files will 
	be parsed and used for further processing. See below for some technical details.
</p>

<h4>Automated generation of indexes</h4>
<p>
	During the document loading and pre-processing mechanism DocFix searches for 
	headers inside your documents. All <span class="label">h2</span> 
	to <span class="label">h5</span> tags are used for creating indexes and 
	chapter summaries. All found headers will be numbered in the order they appeared. 
	(DocFix will start searching for headers in the first specified content file and will 
	continue in the same order they were added.)
</p>
<p>
	By default DocFix searches for headers in all parts of your content files. The following 
	example shows how some parts of your documents can be skipped by the parsing algorithm. 
	Note the <span class="label">data-docfix-parsing</span> attribute.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
<div class="alert alert-info" data-docfix-parsing="skip">
	<h5>Important note!</h5>
	<p>
		The complete alert-div is skipped and therefore no including headers are indexed.
	</p>
</div>
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info" data-docfix-parsing="skip">
	<h5>Important note!</h5>
	<p>
		The complete alert-div is skipped and therefore no including headers are indexed.
	</p>
</div>

<h4>Crossreferences and NavTags</h4>
<p>
	Please see <a href="ref-setup" class="docfix-crossref">Chapter 2</a> for more details.
</p>



<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
	To get DocFix running there is some minimal configuration required. 
</p>

<p>
	The following javascript must be added to the DocFix template file. 
	See below for detailed parameter meanings and possible values.
</p>

<a id="config-setup" class="docfix-navtag">Configuration parameters</a>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-javascript">
docfix.settings = {
	versionInfo: 'docfix-version',
	nav: 'docfix-nav',
	navTags: 'docfix-navtags',
	content: 'docfix-content',
	summary: 'docfix-summary',
	toc: 'docfix-toc',
	topId: 'docfix-top',
	topText: 'Top',
	basePath: '/doc/',
	completeDocButton: 'docfix-showall',
	progress: 'docfix-progress',
	files: ['contentA.html', 'contentB.html', 'contentc.html']
};
</pre>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>

		<td>
			<p>
				This parameter is needed by the content file loader. You may add serveral 
				files to your documentation by adding their filenames to the array of content files.

			</p>
			<p>
				If your content files are located inside the top directory of your virtual host, 
				the <span class="label">basePath</span> has to be "/".
				Otherwise the <span class="label">basePath</span> has to specify the path to your
